# Aethersteel to Aetherite Minecraft Resource Pack
This is a Resource Pack that changes the item names from the [Aethersteel](https://modrinth.com/mod/aethersteel) mod to include "Aetherite" rather than "Aethersteel" and changes the textures from violet to light orange and look more in line with Netherite. It may be used as a Tempate/Base for more Resource Packs, but not lazily reuploaded. Requires [Aethersteel](https://modrinth.com/mod/aethersteel) to be installed to work properly.
